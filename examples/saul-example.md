## Saul's Vault Sweep — 2026-02-16

### Active Schemes
- **Side Project Alpha:** Moving from planning to execution phase. Focus on initial customer validation.
- **Skill Transition:** Building portfolio pieces for career pivot to new technical domain.
- **Agentic System Development:** The Think Tank architecture itself is becoming a core asset.

### Cold Cases
- **Idea Validation Framework:** Notes exist but not actively used. Missing link for project validation.
- **Financial Strategy:** Documents show savings targets but execution is inconsistent.

### Patterns (The Long Con)
- **The "Automation Pivot":** Moving from "building tools" to "building agents that build tools."
- **Research vs. Execution:** Heavy emphasis on planning; lighter on shipping.

### Tensions (The Lie)
- **Stated Goal vs. Activity:** Goal is technical skill development, but time allocation skews toward business development.
- **Planning vs. Doing:** Extensive documentation, less deployment.

### Raw Intel
- Multiple project threads active simultaneously. Risk of diffusion.
