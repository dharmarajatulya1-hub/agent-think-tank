## Mike's Inspection — 2026-02-16

### Discipline Report
- **Workouts:** [HIGH] - Consistent 5x/week rhythm with progressive overload.
- **Supplements:** [IMPROVING] - Core stack consistent. Morning adherence is the key battle.
- **Diet Logging:** [LOW] - Meals tracked inconsistently. Hard to optimize what isn't measured.

### Energy Patterns
- **Sleep Drift:** Late bedtimes on weekends bleeding into weekdays.
- **The Energy Loop:** Evening workouts produce a second wind that delays sleep.

### Trends (The Numbers)
- **Progress:** Stable metrics. Growth has stalled in target areas.
- **Adherence:** Core habits at ~70%. Needs to be 90%+ for desired outcomes.

### Risks (The Problems)
- **Optional Practice:** [CRITICAL] - Morning meditation/focus practice being squeezed out by logistics.
- **Measurement Gap:** Without logged counts, targets are just guesses.

### Opportunities (The Fix)
- **The Evening Window:** Move spiritual/focus practice to 18:00 (pre-workout). Hits the transition window and ensures it isn't "left for last."
- **Breakfast Optimization:** Front-load calories into the morning meal.

### Raw Intel
- Rest day patterns show expected deviation. Back to baseline needed.
