## Gus's Intelligence Brief — 2026-02-16

### Opportunities (The Openings)
- **Agentic Orchestration:** 2026 is the year of "multi-agent workflows" (industry reports). The Think Tank architecture IS the market's highest-value skill.
- **Career Transition Window:** Companies cutting traditional roles while hiring for AI-specialized positions.

### Threats (The Problems)
- **The "Wrapper Bubble":** Simple AI wrappers saturating. The moat isn't the feature; it's the custom agentic workflow.
- **Market Correction Indicators:** Analysts warning of AI bubble deflation. High-leverage skills survive; simple automations won't.

### Learning Signals (The Knowledge)
- **Orchestration Frameworks:** Study the "factory" infrastructure for AI adapters and multi-agent systems.
- **AI as Creation Partner:** Industry shift toward AI-assisted creation vs. just coding assistance.

### Market Pulse (The Territory)
- **Real Estate:** Inventory rising in target areas, but floor remains firm in tech hubs.
- **The FI Gap:** Analysis confirms the gap is income vs. savings rate, not absolute earnings.

### Wild Card (The Angle)
- **Open-Source Signal:** Sanitizing and open-sourcing the Think Tank orchestration logic generates more career leverage than a side product.
